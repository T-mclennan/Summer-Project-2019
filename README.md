# Safe SF Hazard Reporting Platform

This project was from the summer semester of 2019 Software Design class. We worked as a team of 7 and completed as much as we could in the 8 week timeframe. We explored using **Agile design process** and practiced daily **scrum meetings**. 

The goal of our project is to create a platform where citizens of San Francisco can report hazards to the city for cleanup.
